def G_partial_prime(sums, p, d, x, cap, num_at_cap):
    '''
    Consider sequences B in (Z/pZ)^d containing only elements which are 
    between x and p-1, such that no element occurs more than cap times, such 
    that after being concatenated with a fixed sequence A, the resulting 
    sequence is zero-free. Returns the sum, over all such B, of the reciprocal 
    of the number of elements (in A + B) which occur cap times. The entire 
    sequence A is not passed; rather, sums and num_at_cap contain all the 
    necessary information about A.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sums : int
        The set of all subset sums of A in Z/pZ. Represented as an integer,
        where the bit at the s-th position indicates whether s is a sum of 
        a subset of A.
    p : int
        The modulus, must be prime.
    d : int
        The length of desired sequences.
    x : int
        The lower bound for elements of the sequences.
    cap : int
        The cap on the number of times each sequence element may occur.
    num_at_cap : int
        The number of elements of A which are equal to cap.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The sum over all such sequences B of the reciprocal of the number
        of elements in A + B which occur cap times.
